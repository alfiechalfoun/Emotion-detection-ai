In order to run my code fist download requierment.txt
if the modle does no exsist (emotion_detection_model/emotion_detection_modle.h5) 
then open (emotion_detection_model/emotion_ai.py) and run it 
making sure that model.train_modle() is in the last line 

if (my_confusion_matrix.png) doesnt exsis run (emotion_detection_model/confustion_matrix.py)

now you can eather run the (run.py) to just get the live video with the mdole installd or
you can run (main.py) to uses the applciation as intende(d) 

Enjoy :)
